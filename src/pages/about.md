# About

Welcome to My personal website!  

In my spare time, I use R, Scrapy, and R-studio to collect and analyze baseball data. I hope that one day I will be able to devote myself to analyzing baseball, which I love, in an environment surrounded by nature.
I would like to increase the number of pages other than baseball.
If you don't mind, would you like to analyze various things together?
