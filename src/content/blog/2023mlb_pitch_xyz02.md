#### Shohei Ohtani Snapshots -swinging\_strike-

The sweeper escapes to the out course for right-handed hitters, and cuts into the in-course below the knee for left-handed hitters. The ball is difficult for hitters to catch. For left-handed hitters, it should be more effective to use balls that enter the strike zone from the out-course ball course.
